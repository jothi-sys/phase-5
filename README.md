### Nm-phase-5
Energy efficiency optimization

### Energy Efficiency Optimization Generator
This project is designed to automatically generate optimized energy-saving configurations using data-driven analysis and mathematical optimization techniques. It can be applied to buildings, industrial systems, or any energy-intensive operation.

### Overview
The goal of this tool is to reduce energy consumption by analyzing historical usage patterns and generating optimized configurations that maintain performance while improving efficiency. It supports predictive modeling, constraint-based optimization, and reporting.

### Features
- Analyze historical energy consumption data
- Generate optimized energy settings (e.g., temperature schedules, lighting times)
- Support for constraint-based optimization (comfort, equipment limits)
- Forecast energy usage using machine learning models
- Export recommendations as JSON, CSV, or visual reports

### Technologies Used
- Python 3.8+
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn / XGBoost
- Pyomo / PuLP (for optimization)
- Matplotlib / Plotly (for data visualization)
- Streamlit (optional dashboard)
- EnergyPlus / eppy (optional simulation support)
